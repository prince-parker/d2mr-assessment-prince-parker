title: "Level 2 Data Wrangling: Recreate a gapminder Dataset"
---

# Objective

This advanced data transformation assignment challenges you to practice **complex data wrangling** techniques using the tidyverse ecosystem. You will work with the `gapminder` dataset, applying more sophisticated data manipulation skills with minimal guidance.

In this Level 2 Recreation assignment, you will load a built-in dataset then make changes to match the provided goal dataset. Few instructions are provided, challenging you to think critically and apply your problem solving skills to recreate the dataset independently.

You may additionally or alternatively complete the [Level 1 wrangling assignment](recreate-level-1.qmd), which uses a simpler goal dataframe and provides more detailed instructions.

# Setup

## Load libraries and set seed

```{r}
#| label: setup
 
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(daff) # for diff_data()

set.seed(5678)
```

## Load your goal tibble to replicate

Run this chunk to see what your end product should look like.


```{r}

#| label: load-goal-tibble

##### DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK #####
## With the 1 exception of if you need to change the relative file path

gm.wrangled.goal <- read_csv("gm-wrangled-goal.csv", 
    col_types = "ccfiicddfidddill")


# View in console
gm.wrangled.goal 

```

Start by saving the `gapminder` dataset to a new tbl called `gm.wrangled`. You will then make changes to this tbl to match the goal dataset.

```{r}
#| label: load-starting-data

# create gm.wrangled


```


Before you start making changes to the `gm.wrangled` dataset, identify the differences between the `gm.wrangled` and `gm.wrangled.goal` datasets. There are multiple ways to do this, including the `all.equal()` function and the `diff_data()` function from the `daff` package. In this case, I recommend trying out both. Think about what the advantages and disadvantages of each are. Which is easier for you to understand? Which is more sensitive? Which guides you to focus on meaningful differences?

```{r}
#| label: compare-datasets

# Compare datasets using all.equal(), diff_data(), or another method of your choice


```



### Notes on comparisons 

The `all.equal()` function is extremely sensitive. It may identify differences in object attributes that are not actually problematic. You may need to do some manual inspection to determine if the differences are significant. The `diff_data()` function is more focused on the data itself, but it may not be as sensitive to differences in object attributes, which can be a strength or weakness. You'll have to decide. 

There are actually a few places where the goal dataset isn't ideal. You may want to consider whether you should try to match the goal dataset exactly or if you want to (deliberately and with clear explanation!) deviate from it in some ways. (Hint: there are at least a few improvements you could make regarding data types, and factors specifically.)



## Make a Plan 

Create a plan to address the differences between the `gm.wrangled` and `gm.wrangled.goal` datasets. What changes do you need to make? What functions will you use to make these changes?

  1. List
  2. your
  3. steps
  4. here
  5. etc...
  
### Suggested functions

If you need help getting started, consider using the following functions in your transformation pipeline:

- `mutate()`, `across()`
- `group_by()`, `ungroup()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`
- `separate_wider_delim()`
- `str_to_upper()`, `str_detect()`, `str_replace()`, `str_sub()`, `str_length()`
- `select()`, `rename()`, `relocate()`
- `replace_na()`
- `factor()`, `fct_relevel()`, `fct_recode()`
- `min_rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `row_number()`
- `case_when()`, `if_else()`

This list is neither exhaustive nor prescriptive. You can use any other functions you find helpful, and you don't need to use all of these functions to complete the assignment. Bear in mind that in order to meet course objectives, you should prioritize using tidyverse functions when possible. 

### Derived variables

You'll create multiple derived variables during this process. Many of them are not obvious; you'll need to puzzle some of them out. Think about what kind of information would be useful to have in the dataset and create variables that provide that information. If you don't quite understand a variable conceptually, you can try to reverse-engineer it from the data. If you're really stuck, that's ok. Add whatever code you can to get as close as possible, then add placeholder comments that describe what you think you're still missing.


# Transformation Challenges

Below are some loose, suggested categories of transformations you'll need to make to recreate the `gm.wrangled.goal` dataset. You may need to combine multiple steps to achieve the desired result. You don't need to stick to the breakdown of steps given below. Feel free to add more categories or subcategories as needed.

**Feeling stuck?** Try breaking down the problem into smaller parts. For example, if you're having trouble creating a new variable, try breaking it down into the steps you would need to take to create that variable. What columns would you need to reference? What functions would you need to use? What would the logic look like?

## Data Selection and Initial Manipulation

The chunk(s) in this category may include things like selecting and renaming columns, filtering rows, and handling missing data.

```{r}

#| label: initial-manipulation

# Data Selection and Initial Manipulation

```


## Factor Manipulation

The chunk(s) in this category may include things like releveling factor variables, creating new factor variables, and implementing conditional factor transformations.

```{r}

#| label: factor-manipulation

# Factor Manipulation

  
```


## String and Numeric Transformations

The chunk(s) in this category may include things like text manipulation, creating compound variables, and implementing mathematical transformations.

```{r}

#| label: string-numeric-transformations

# String and Numeric Transformations



```

## Complex Column Operations

The chunk(s) in this category may include things like generating new columns based on multiple existing columns, implementing window functions, and creating summary statistics within groups.

```{r}

#| label: complex-operations

# Complex Column Operations

```

## Final Touches

The chunk(s) in this category may include things like final column reordering, sorting, and any other miscellaneous transformations.

```{r}

#| label: final-touches

# Final Touches

```

# Checkpoint: compare dataframes

Check whether your `gm.wrangled` dataframe is identical to the goal dataframe. Like before, you can use `all_equal()`, `diff_data()`, or another method of your choice.

```{r}

#| label: compare-dataframes-again

# Compare dataframes again

```

**QUESTION:** What differences remain between your `gm.wrangled` and `gm.wrangled.goal` datasets?

  1. Are there any differences you tried to solve but weren't able to? How far did you get? What do you think you're missing?
  2. Are there any differences that the `all.equal()` or `diff_data()` functions identified that you don't think are significant? What are they and what do they mean? Why do you believe they are non-essential?

# OPTIONAL: Unguided cleaning and transformation

*Optional:* If you have the time and interest, continue transforming this dataset as you please in a new dataframe called `gm.optional`. **DO NOT SAVE OVER YOUR `gm.wrangled` DATAFRAME.** Create new columns based on the existing ones, reformat strings, try your hand at a regex replacement, summarize by groups (factor levels), visualize a simple relationship, or anything else you can think of. You can do this in addition to or instead of the additional cleaning tasks above. 

You can do these transformations one pipe/chunk or several. Either way, include appropriate chunk labels as well as comments to explain your thought process and the steps you are taking. 
Beyond random transforms, try creating an additional transformation pipeline that generates insights about global trends, potentially involving:

  - Aggregating data at different levels
  - Calculating rolling averages
  - Creating interaction variables
  - Implementing more complex filtering strategies
  - Joining with other datasets (hint: figure out which columns are likely to align with other datasets you might find online)


```{r}

#| label: rename-me-to-something-sensible

#gm.optional <- gm.wrangled
  # your code here

```

# OPTIONAL: Export/write your data to .csv

If you would like to export your dataframe(s) to a .csv file, you can use the `write_csv()` function from the `readr` package. This is not required, but can demonstrate the skill.

```{r}
#| label: export-data

# Write gm.wrangled to a .csv file


# Write gm.optional to a .csv file


```



# Submission & Assessment

Before submitting, double check that your `gm.wrangled` dataframe matches the `gm.wrangled.goal` dataframe using something like `all.equal()` or `diff_data()`. Remember that in this more complex recreation assignment, you may not be able to clear 100% of the differences you identify. You should aim to get as close as possible, and then address remaining discrepancies in the section above.

If you optionally chose to continue transforming, that should be a *different dataframe.*
